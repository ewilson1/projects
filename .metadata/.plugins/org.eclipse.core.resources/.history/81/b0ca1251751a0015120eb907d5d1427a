//So, an imageView's main property is called 'image:' and this is the path to the image file you are trying to load.

//you have to instruct the application to look for the directory where the image is located. In this case, the "Resorces"
//file, which is located in the 'images' folder.

//so, before calling the actual image itself, you have to point it to the correct folder. The folder name is images

//its auto-filling the size because we did not specify a size, the borderRadius is applied along with the left and right space
